#+title: Nix Configuration

I'm making another attempt at learning Nix, as it seems incredibly
useful for managing my environment for different projects.

For the darwin parts I've used [[https://blog.sulami.xyz/posts/nix-for-developers/][Robin Schroer's blog post]] and [[https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/][Ian
Henry's stream of conciousness]] as my guides. I'll probably check out
the manual too, one day.

For the home-manager stuff, I've used Ju Liu's [[https://juliu.is/tidying-your-home-with-nix/][Tidying up your $HOME
with Nix]] post as a reference. The home-manager manual also lent some
help to integrating home-manager and nix-darwin.
